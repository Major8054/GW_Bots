;
; This file contains all headers that gwa2 uses to communicate with the gameservers directly.
;
; The headers are named variables. The names should indicate what the header is about.
; The comments give a litte more detail about what the header does.
;
; This makes the source code of gwa2 a little better readable. Also it allows to update headers more easily, as they
; are all now in a small separate place as a list to work yourself through.
; If you need to update the headers, the comments give hints about what action to trigger while recording CtoGS packets.
